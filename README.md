# Deliveries — React + TypeScript Assessment (Skeleton)

This is the **skeleton** starter repo for the Deliveries assessment. It includes a minimal Create React App (TypeScript) setup, Tailwind config, sample data, and a presentational DeliveriesList component stub — **no business logic is included**.

## What you should implement 
- Implement `src/components/DeliveriesList.tsx` to satisfy the assignment in `ISSUE.md`.
- Do not change the project structure; add your edits in the existing files and commit incrementally (>= 3 commits).
- Update the `README.md` file with instructions and a short design note.

## Use Yarn
This project expects Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```
